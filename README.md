Polynomial Regression Project
This project demonstrates polynomial regression using synthetic data generated with NumPy. The aim is to fit polynomial models of different degrees to the data and compare their performance metrics.

Project Description
Data Generation
The project uses NumPy to generate synthetic data based on a third-degree polynomial with added noise to simulate real-world conditions. A scatter plot is created to visualize the generated data.

Models
The following polynomial regression models are applied in the project:

First-degree model
Second-degree model
Third-degree model
Fourth-degree model
Fifth-degree model
Each model is analyzed for its fit to the data and evaluated using appropriate metrics.

Visualizations
The project includes scatter plots and fitted curves, enabling visualization of the data and model results.
