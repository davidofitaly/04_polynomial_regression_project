# Polynomial Regression Project

This project demonstrates polynomial regression using synthetic data generated with NumPy. 
It fits polynomial models of varying degrees to the data and compares their performance metrics.

## Clone

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/davidofitaly/02_polynomial_regression.git

## Install

Install the required dependencies using pip:


pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Navigate to the project directory:

cd 02_polynomial_regression

Run the Jupyter Notebook:


Open the polynomial_regression.ipynb file and run the cells to conduct the analysis.

## Project Overview

Data Generation: Synthetic data is created based on a third-degree polynomial with added noise to simulate real-world conditions.

Models: The project fits polynomial regression models of the following degrees:

First-degree model

Second-degree model

Third-degree model

Fourth-degree model

Fifth-degree model

## Visualizations

The project includes scatter plots and fitted curves to visualize the generated data and the results of the models.
